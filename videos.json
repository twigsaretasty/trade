This one is most commonly listed as April 4th or 10th, but has also been listed as April 20th, 24th, and has even been mixed up with the May 29th video.

The washout has mostly been fixed in editing but it's impossible to fully correct. The recording has more zooms than I would like, to prevent further washout. Fortunately, this production is minimalistic and performance-focused so it doesn't hinder the overall experience of the show. The recording is mainly filmed in close-ups and mediums. A head is sometimes visible in the wide shots of the musical numbers. Recording includes the curtain call and marquee.",

Dan and Charissa are both fantastic in their roles as well. The show is absolutely hysterical, much improved from the movie version. The first minute of Act One is blacked out, but the show is otherwise fully intact with no blackouts and only slight washout in a few wide shots. There is no obstruction, the video is steady, the sound is excellent, and its captured very well with the usual mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. Its filmed in 16:9 and includes curtain call, encore, and playbill scans.</p><br><br>GENERAL NOTES: Available as both a widely circulated DVD, and a much rarer 1080p Blu-Ray.",

            "notes": "Beautiful 4K capture of the 2022-2023 National Tour! An especially hilarious performance from all in this updated script with relevant references for today. It's filmed in 16:9 from the front center grand tier with a mix of wides, mediums, and closeups. There are no obstructions or blackouts but there is some occasional washout due to the spotlights used during darker scenes such as the Jailhouse. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.",

This is very nicely captured with no washout, no major blackouts, and very little obstruction. A railing blocks the very front left corner of the stage, but only the actors' legs are unseen. Telly is audio only; the video for Act Two begins when the house lights go down and Lavender takes the stage. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent.

Lindsay Mendez, Jonathan Groff, and Katie Rose Clarke are all cementing their performances as the defining interpretations of their characters.

There is a lady in front of me with a really large ugly hat in Act 1. This blocks most action dead center stage but is worked around as well as possible. Act 2 is a little better because the hat is not on her head. Overall not the best video but it's watchable, especially if you watch the edited version. This cast was fantastic.",

            "notes": "Filmed in 4K (released as 1080p and 4K). A historic night on Broadway, with Brittney Johnson's first show as full-time Glinda after having been a standby for 3 years, being the first POC to play the role ever. Also Sharon Sach's first show as Madame Morrible after a transfer from the Tour, making her Broadway debut. No significant obstructions, minimal spotlight washout\u2014excellent picture throughout. Only significant dropout is at the start of \u201cDancing Through Life\u201d (literally only 20 seconds). Never to be sold except by master, never to be posted anywhere online.",

            "notes": "Excellent HD capture of Broadway's first Black Glinda and the first Elphaba to have never played the role before in over half a decade! A very Elphaba and Glinda-centric video, it's filmed from the left orchestra with a mix of wides, mediums, and many closeups, with occasional dropouts due to ushers. A bit shaky throughout. Both acts start a minute in. Please do not post screenshots of this video on Twitter ever. Gifs on Tumblr are okay after the NFT date, but don't go linking things to actors and shows.",

Overall the best of the early Wicked videos. Multiple versions circulate, so check with traders. (One-disc version includes NY1 Review Segment, Today Show performance, and Letterman performance. Two-disc version is lower generation (higher quality) but does not include the extras.)<br><br>MY NOTES: Does not include the extras",
