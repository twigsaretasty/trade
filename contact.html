                <p class="text">I prefer looking at Encora collections as it's easier to cross reference with my own, but personal docs/websites/lists are completely fine! Please make sure yours includes show titles, tours, cast (where applicable), dates, and (ideally) formats.</p>
                <p class="text">Though I try to reply pretty quickly, please wait for at least a week before contact me again! I do my best to reply to every email I get, but patience is greatly appreciated.</p>
                <p class="text">Even if your collection is small or if you don't have anything in my wants list, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm sure we can work something out. I am generally <b>willing to gift recordings</b> to newer traders, but please still send your list over if you have one. If you're unable to trade for something, </p>
                <p class="text">I prefer to be contacted <b>through email</b> as it is easier for me to keep track of trades. My Discord is listed for reference, but please do not contact me there for trading inquiries. I'm happy to have a chat about shows whenever, though, so feel free to reach out! Email or Discord would be fine for general discussion.</p>
                <p class="text">Standard ratios apply, whoever initiates sends their links first, etc.</p>
                <p class="text">Happy trading! :)</p>
